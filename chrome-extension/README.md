cd chrome-extension
npm install
npm start
```

Load the chrome extension into your chrome/chromium browser

You'll need to be in developer mode to do this:https://webkul.com/blog/how-to-install-the-unpacked-extension-in-chrome/

Choose the "build" folder. If you click on the LinkThree extension icon, you should see a blank "LinkThree" page.

Now, when you go to a block explorer, you can right click on an address and click on "Link Three Popup".
